# Linear_regression
Practice Project
This is a sandpit to play around with panda, numpy, scipy and sklearn on a very simple linear regression.
Having such a simple dataset to play with (it's only got one feature) means I can concentrate on using
 the commands rather than being overly concerned about the data. I am following a process of:
1. Load data
2. Clean data
3. Train model with training dataset
4. Have a look at the statistics
5. Test the trained model with provided test dataset
It would be great if someone could verify the statistical assumptions and use of the formulas below.
It's the first time I have used them, so there could be mistakes!!
